# Great apps have a clear structure
Back in Chapter 6, we looked at ways of structuring an app to create the best user experience. Remember that when you create an app, you will have three different types of screen:
### Top-Level Screens
This is usually the first activity in your app that your user sees.
### Category Screens
Category screens show the data that belongs to a particular category, often in a list. They allow the user to navigate to detail/edit screens.
### Detail/Edit Screens
These display details for a particular record, let the user edit the record, or allow the user to enter new records.

### They also have great shortcuts
If a user’s going to use your app a lot, they’ll want quick ways to get around. We’re going to look at navigational views that will give your user shortcuts around your app, providing more space in your app for actual content. Let’s begin by taking a closer look at the top-level screen in the above Pizza app.
