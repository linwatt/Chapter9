The first 3 options link to category activities; the first presents a list of pizzas, the second presents a list of pasta etc. You can think of the category activities as being **passive**. They display info to help you get around.

The fourth option links to a detail/edit activity that allows the user to create an order. This option is **active**: it allows a user to create something.
