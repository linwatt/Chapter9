The action bar has a number of uses:
- For displaying the app or activity name so that the user knows where in the app they are. As an example, an email app might use it to indicate whether the user is in her inbox or junk folder.

- For making key actions prominent in a way that’s predictable—for example, sharing content or performing searches.

- For navigating to other activities to perform an action.


To add an action bar, you need to use a **theme** that includes an action bar. A theme is a style that’s applied to an entire activity or application so that your app has a consistent look and feel. It controls such things as the color of the activity background and action bar, and the style of the text. Android has a number of built-in themes you can use.
