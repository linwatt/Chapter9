If you want your apps to run on API level 11 or above, you add an action bar by applying `Theme.Holo` or one of its subclasses. This is what youâ€™ll need to do most of the time. 

For API level 21 or above, you have the added option of using one of the newer `Theme.Material` themes. There are several different themes to choose from depending on what appearance you want your app to have. As an example, applying a theme of `Theme.Material.Light.DarkActionBar` will give you activities with a light background and a dark action bar.

If you need to support older devices running API level 7 or above, you can still add an action bar but you need to do it slightly differently. You first need to change your activities so that they extend the class `android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity` instead of the `android.app.Activity` class. You must then apply one of the `Theme.AppCompat` themes.
