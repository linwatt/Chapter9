In Android apps, **active** navigational options are usually added to the **action bar**. The action bar is the bar you often see at the top of activities. Itâ€™s the place where common actions are displayed, so it normally includes buttons that are best described using verbs such as Create, Search, or Edit.


In the Pizza app, we can make it easy for the user to place an order wherever they are in the app by adding an action bar to the top of every activity. The action bar will include a Create Order button so the user has access to it wherever they are.
